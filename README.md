# Unity-LazyGrassGenerator

Currently diving into grass generation in Unity. I’ve managed to create a single script that can generate grass on any mesh, leveraging the Job System and Graphics.RenderMeshInstanced.  

> **_NOTE:_**
While the performance isn’t exceptionally high (since it’s not a compute shader), it does provide a quick glimpse of how you can add grass to your game. :)
